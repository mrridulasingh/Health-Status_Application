# Health Status Application

Due to environmental conditions and unhealthy habits, people face various diseases. So the prediction of disease at earlier stage becomes important task. But the accurate prediction on the basis of symptoms becomes too difficult for doctor. Machine Learning is an emerging approach that helps in prediction, diagnosis of a disease.
To overcome these problems, "Health Status Application" is developed for the prediction of heart, liver and breast cancer disease based on symptoms using machine learning.

## Heart disease
This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.

## Liver Disease
This data set contains 416 liver patient records and 167 non liver patient records collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. The "Dataset" column is a class label used to divide groups into liver patient (liver disease) or not (no disease). This data set contains 441 male patient records and 142 female patient records. Any patient whose age exceeded 89 is listed as being of age "90".

## Breast Cancer Disease
Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. n the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].
